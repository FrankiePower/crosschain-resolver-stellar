 i have about 3 days left. when i compete i go all in. so ui, 
  partial fills, the whole nine yards

  🎮 KILLER FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

  Core Differentiators

  1. Full Bidirectional - EVM→Stellar AND Stellar→EVM
  2. Partial Fills - Split large orders across multiple fills
  3. Multi-Asset - Support major tokens, not just test tokens
  4. Production UI - Actually usable, not just proof-of-concept

  Advanced Features

  1. Cross-chain price discovery - Real price feeds
  2. MEV protection - Private mempool integration
  3. Gas optimization - Batch transactions
  4. Failure recovery - Automatic retry mechanisms

  Bonus Wow Factors

  1. Mobile responsive - Works on phones
  2. Analytics dashboard - Volume, fees, success rates
  3. API endpoints - Other developers can integrate
  4. Multi-network - Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon

  💪 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES

  What Crushes Competition:

  1. Only team with working EVM↔Stellar atomic swaps
  2. Partial fills (most teams won't have this)
  3. Production-ready UI (most will be CLI demos)
  4. Bidirectional (most will be one-way only)
  5. Multi-asset support (real value, not just test tokens)

  Psychological Edge:

  - Professional presentation vs hackathon demos
  - Real usage vs proof-of-concept
  - Technical depth that shows expertise
  - Completeness that shows we went ALL-IN

  📋 TODAY'S IMMEDIATE TASKS

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Fix XDR parsing error properly - no try-catch hacks       
     ☐ Get all tests passing cleanly with proper balance tracking
     ☐ Implement bidirectional swaps (Stellar→EVM direction)
     ☐ Add partial fills support with merkle tree secrets
     ☐ Build production-grade UI with wallet integrations
     ☐ Deploy contracts on mainnet/Arbitrum/Base
     ☐ Add real asset support (USDC, ETH, XLM)
     ☐ Create demo environment and recording

⏺ 🔥 LET'S GO ALL-IN!

  Right now, let's tackle the XDR issue head-on. No more
  workarounds - let's fix it properly so we have a rock-solid
  foundation for the next 3 days.

  Question: Should we:
  1. Deep dive into the XDR parsing issue and fix it at the root
  level?
  2. Parallel approach - I fix XDR while you start on
  bidirectional swaps?
  3. Architecture first - Plan out the full technical stack before
   coding?

  I'm ready to work around the clock with you. Let's build
  something that doesn't just win - let's build something that
  changes the game.

  Cross-Chain Swap Flow: EVM USDC → Stellar USDC

  User's Goal: Swap 100 USDC on Ethereum for 99 USDC on
   Stellar

  User Provides Two Addresses:
  1. EVM Address: 0x742d35Cc... (where they currently
  hold USDC on Ethereum)
  2. Stellar Address: GCAXA5L4T7G... (where they want
  to receive USDC on Stellar)

  The Actual Flow

  Phase 1: User Setup
  - User has 100 USDC in their EVM wallet
  - User wants to receive 99 USDC at their Stellar
  address

  Phase 2: EVM Side (Source)
  - User creates an order and locks 100 USDC in an EVM
  escrow contract
  - Resolver fills the order on EVM side

  Phase 3: Stellar Side (Destination)
  - Resolver deploys a Stellar escrow with 99 USDC
  - Resolver funds the Stellar escrow with their own
  USDC

  Phase 4: Atomic Execution (CORRECTED)
  - User uses their Stellar address + secret →
  withdraws from Stellar escrow → gets 99 USDC at their
   Stellar address
  - Resolver sees the secret revealed → uses secret on
  EVM with resolver's EVM address → gets the 100 USDC
  from EVM escrow

 Yes, that makes perfect sense! Now I
  understand the flow completely:

  Why This Flow Makes Sense

  Economic Incentives Align Perfectly:

  1. User goes first (on Stellar):
    - User has the secret (only they know it
   initially)
    - User wants their 99 USDC on Stellar
    - By withdrawing on Stellar, they reveal
   the secret publicly but get their desired
   USDC
  2. Resolver follows (on EVM):
    - Resolver sees the secret is now public
   on Stellar blockchain
    - Resolver uses that secret to withdraw
  the 100 USDC from EVM escrow
    - Resolver gets compensated for
  providing the cross-chain service

  Security:
  - User can't get Stellar USDC without
  revealing the secret
  - Once secret is revealed, resolver is
  guaranteed to get their EVM USDC
  - It's atomic because either both succeed
  or neither does

  Risk Distribution:
  - User takes the first step but gets what
  they want
  - Resolver takes the "following" step but
  is guaranteed success once user moves

  This explains why in our test:
  - User (with userStellarKeypair) calls
  Stellar withdraw() first
  - Resolver (with srcChainResolver) calls
  EVM withdraw() second using the revealed
  secret

  The balance verification should check:
  - User's Stellar address gained 99 USDC
  - Resolver's EVM address gained 100 USDC

  Does this match what our test is actually
  doing?
